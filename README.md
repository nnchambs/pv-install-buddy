This little app allows a user to search by zip code and state/county for the cost and count of photovoltaic installations by zip code. The user can save individual zip codes to their list of "green places" to see which zip code is the most optimized for their next photovoltaic installation. :-) 

Check it out in production [here](https://pv-buddy.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
